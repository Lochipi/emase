## Configuration

Before customizing your portfolio, it's essential to configure your personal information, projects, and skills. ‚öôÔ∏è

### Personal Information

Edit the file with your personal information, such as your name, job title, email, and social media links.

### Projects

Add your projects to the `data/projects.ts` file. Each project should have a title, description, GitHub repository link, and a live demo link if available.

### Skills

Add your skills to the `assets/data.tsx` file. You can organize them into different categories and assign each skill a rating.

## Customization

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the styling by editing the Tailwind CSS configuration file located at `tailwind.config.js`.

To generate your own CSS, you can create new stylesheets in the `styles` directory and import them into your components.

### Content

Customize the content of your website by editing the components in the `components` directory. You can modify the layout, add new sections, or make any other changes to match your personal branding.

## Deployment

To deploy your portfolio website, follow the deployment instructions provided by the platform of your choice. You can deploy it on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any hosting service that supports Next.js applications.

Remember to set environment variables, if necessary, to keep sensitive information secure, and to optimize your website for production deployment. üåê
